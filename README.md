# compact-closed

Tensor contraction notation in full categorical generality (specializable, of
course, to the particularly concrete case of Cartesian vector spaces). String
diagrams generated from morphisms in a free compact closed category (except not
actuallyâ€”more like a free magmoid on generators that happen to resemble a
compact closed category). Inscrutable, uncommented code.
